Statement of Martin Hughes, regarding a strange and disturbing occurrence at Dunloag Lighthouse, off the coast of Scotland in July 1993. Original statement given August 12th, 1993. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, head archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

I'm not entirely sure what you hope I’ll tell you that my letters haven’t already said, though perhaps hearing it said aloud will help me put it to rest. The nightmares have persisted, and to be honest, they're the real reason I'm here at all. But I've started mid-way, haven't I? Let me start again from the beginning.

I accepted the Dunloag Lighthouse posting because it was isolated. Because the silence has always calmed my nerves, and the work was simple enough. I’d spent almost eight peaceful months there, maintaining the lamp each night, reading voraciously throughout the daylight hours, and experiencing the rare joy of my own company. Occasionally I’d meet contact on the mainland, exchange supplies and news, but it was seldom. It was peaceful there, peaceful until that night in July.

On the night of the fifth—to be exact—I noticed the fog rolling in. Thick, impenetrable, a grey shroud that swallowed the horizon. Fog's nothing unusual there, of course; visibility can shift rapidly, and I'd seen plenty of foggy nights before. But this fog was disconcerting, somehow thicker, almost gelatinous. The tendrils of vapor seemed to flow upward, coiling around the lighthouse as if measuring it, exploring it.

I tended the beacon, verifying the brightness, checking the rotation. Everything appeared functional. Then it was that I heard—or at first thought I imagined—a gentle tapping sound. It came from below, from the outside of the lighthouse wall—at sea-level, I realized with confusion. No boat could have docked there unseen in that fog, and there’s no landing to speak of on that side of the rocks.

At first, I ignored it. Wind, perhaps, waves hitting just right against the stones. But as the hours passed, the tapping continued. It wasn't rhythmic, exactly, but it was persistent, rapid little clicks like the impatient rapping of someone's fingernails upon a wooden board.

Eventually curiosity got the better of my caution. Lantern in hand, I descended the winding stair and carefully opened the lower door, stepping out into the swirling fog. The obscurity stretched only inches beyond my reach. I tried to call out—half-heartedly, I’ll admit—but my voice felt swallowed instantly by the thick white fog; it clung to my skin, oily and cold.

I edged toward the side wall where the tapping had come from, feeling along wet brick. My glove touched something soft, spongy and slick, and I recoiled. Raising the lantern, I saw dark-gray marks upon the bricks, an oily film leaving faint imprints swirling from the base up the side, disappearing higher up into the clouded darkness above. It looked almost—no, not almost—I still shudder at the thought: it looked exactly like the slime a snail leaves behind, but enormous, impossibly large.

That was when the tapping abruptly stopped. In the silence that followed, I fully grasped how utterly isolated and helpless I truly was.

I went back inside, locked the door—though what good does a lock do against fog, slime, and shadows, I don't pretend to know—and climbed immediately to the beacon room, heart hammering as I ascended. The fog had thickened impossibly now, pressing itself purposefully against the glass. With mounting dread, I saw the surface swirl and shift, and I had an insane feeling it was attempting to get inside.

Then the tapping returned, urgent this time, louder. It moved upward around the lighthouse wall, spiraling steadily closer. I stood still, unable to breathe comfortably, unable to look away. The fog settled on the windows and I glimpsed something dark forming just behind my reflection: shapes twisting and folding, rising, vaguely human-like but wrong, so wrong in movement and shape. It came closer, pressing against the glass, featureless but purposeful, hands—or something like hands—tapping insistent, gently, almost politely, determined to be let in.

I don’t know when I screamed. But suddenly my own shriek echoed against the walls, and in an instant the presence vanished, withdrawing swiftly into the fog like an animal startled by a louder predator. When morning finally dispersed the fog, there was nothing left outside to indicate what had happened, not a trace of that slippery blackness, nor any markings whatsoever on the brick or rock. I half-convinced myself I’d imagined the whole ordeal.

Except, when I left the lighthouse days later, relieved to be away, I saw a small shape half-covered by sand and seaweed on the stones on the pier. I fetched it from the rugged coastline, a shell almost as large as my palm, smooth and iridescent like mother-of-pearl. Yet twisted horribly out of shape, as though something impossibly big and distorted had forced itself free of it. A thing that should never be. A hateful little remnant of whatever visited me.

It's here, actually; I brought it. I had hoped showing it might lend me credibility, though now I realize it sounds ludicrous, even seeing it firsthand. Please, take it, I no longer wish—yes, thank you.

Since Dunloag, nightmares have overtaken my sleep. Fog encroaches everywhere now, even in the comfort of my flat, even in dreams, and in it, things soft and boneless tap endlessly against glass doors that should not exist. I never see clearly what’s there, in the dreams, only shapes writhing at the corners of my vision, soft things, whispering—pleading—to be let in. Perhaps it will fade now that I am rid of the shell, perhaps not. But know this:

Fog is no friend. And there are worse things to fear out there in that thick, pressing gloom. Things that slip from the ocean onto land—quiet, pliable, impossibly formed—and tap respectfully until someone allows them in.

Archivist’s note: The shell Martin describes was catalogued and stored carefully in Artifact Storage. However, despite further attempts to contact him, Martin Hughes has thus far failed to respond. We reached out to Dunloag authorities, but no trace of the phenomena he recounted—or indeed Martin himself—has since been recovered or reported. Of course, there’s always fog at Dunloag Lighthouse.

Statement of Lydia Andrews, regarding her experiences during her night shift at Grovewood Retirement Home. Original statement collected 14 October, 2014. Statement given directly from subject; audio recorded by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of The Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

You'd think taking on the night shift at a retirement home would be peaceful, wouldn't you? After all, how much excitement can happen surrounded by sleeping elderly residents and the hushed chirping of crickets outside? When I first took the job at Grovewood Retirement Home in the autumn of 2012, that was exactly what I imagined. I desperately needed work after moving to London, and the pay was above average. The manager, Mr. Swinton, warned me, though—something cryptic and unsettling, half-joking but tinted with seriousness—that some new staff struggled with nighttime solitude. "Best keep busy and don’t pay too much mind to what you hear," he had muttered, smiling vaguely. 

My shifts were lonely, for sure. It was a small, tidy building, tucked away from the main road and encased by tall oak trees whose shadows fell across windows like skeletal fingers. My tasks involved routine checks on residents every two hours, paperwork, and the nightly walk-through: turning off stray lights, locking doors, double-checking the alarm system.

Quiet at first, comforting almost, until about my third shift. That night I was tired, but not drowsy enough to mistake what I experienced. As I walked through the dim hallway of the north wing after midnight, I thought I saw movement down the corridor, in the window reflection at the end. I spun around to see nothing; only emptiness in that soft glow from wall-mounted nightlights. Shaking myself awake, putting it down to paranoia, I carried on hastily and reached room fourteen. 

Mrs. Eleanor Garvey slept there, elderly and frail, bound to bed by medical necessity. But when I opened the door for inspection... she wasn't in bed. Her sheets lay neatly folded, untouched by human hands. The room had an unnatural stillness—no hum of ventilators or faint beeping monitors. I panicked, of course, fearing she'd wandered off somehow. But as soon as I left the room to alert supervisors, the hall seemed suddenly longer, unfamiliar. My voice echoed as I called her name—a hollow, sterile sound bouncing off cold walls.

Halfway back down the corridor, I heard it—the strangest noise. At first, I dismissed it as tapping pipes or tree branches brushing windows from outside. Sharp, irregular knocks echoing gently from close by, distinctly human sounding—like frail knuckles softly rapping, seeking attention, seeking entry. The source seemed intangible, shifting from room to room as I pursued it. Each door I opened revealed another elderly occupant sleeping soundly, undisturbed.

Then came whispers. Soft, muttered tones, indistinct but unmistakably elderly in nature—wavering, confused, pleading. Eventually, I returned desperately towards Mrs. Garvey’s room, hoping I'd simply overlooked something. And there, standing just outside her door, as if she'd always been there, was Eleanor Garvey herself, eyes glazed, translucent skin paper-thin and pale, moonlight giving her form an ethereal quality. 

"Mrs. Garvey…?" I breathed.

She only smiled vacantly, eyes cloudy, shifting strangely to stare past me, over my shoulder. Her mouth opened slowly, painfully:

"They’re knocking. They want out. Or maybe… they want in."

Before I could process, she shuffled silently back to bed, as if the muscles beneath her thin legs were marionette strings tugged slowly back towards the mattress. I checked on her immediately—her heart rate strong, her breathing steady. But somehow, I couldn't shake the impression that this Eleanor I'd spoken to was not the same Mrs. Garvey I saw each night after that, sleeping in her usual state, unaware of my previous nocturnal encounter.

It didn't stop after that evening. The knocking, soft whispers, a movement in the corner of the eye that vanished when I focused. Occasionally, I'd see dark forms, shambling shapes pacing corridors outside patients' rooms—as if their shadows had been cast loose and were seeking a way back inside. I brought it up tentatively with management after a week, but Mr. Swinton only sighed deeply, gave me a knowing look, and muttered something vague about the building’s “history” before dismissing my concerns.

My breaking point came a month later—my final shift at Grovewood. Completing my routine checks, I began walking towards the main entrance, the feeling of being watched heavier than I'd ever felt before—and this time, when I glanced at the reflection in the office windows as I passed, I saw them clearly: figures standing still behind me, dark and silhouetted—fragile, hunched, dozens of them lining the corridor, all elderly, all silently staring. When I dared to turn around—nothing. Corridor empty, lights flickering softly, silence heavy.

I ran. I stopped only when I reached my car, hands trembling as I fumbled for the keys. Grovewood Retirement Home stood darkly behind me, windows like hollow eyes—watching, always watching.

I refused to return, even for my paycheck; I arranged for the money to be posted.

I wish I knew what presence lingered there. I wondered if the elderly occupants weren't its prey, but perhaps its prison—or its disguise. Every night, I dream of those whispers and knocking sounds, of Mrs. Garvey staring past me, warning me. Warning me they're looking for a way out.

Or maybe, a way inside somewhere new.

Statement ends.

Archivist’s Note: Further research into Grovewood Retirement Home revealed its immediate closure and demolition shortly after Miss Andrews' departure, citing structural instability—though the home had reportedly undergone recent renovations. Most staffing records have proved elusive, and inquiries to former management have so far gone unanswered. Tim has proposed an expedition to the site. Elias has requested caution: "No unnecessary risk."

Statement of Marcus Bennett, regarding unusual events encountered at an abandoned greenhouse on Briar Lane, dated 12th June, 2012. Statement recorded from subject, 4th July, 2012. Archivist Jonathan Sims recording.

Statement begins.

It wasn’t the first time I'd noticed the place. You know how certain locations draw your attention—not in an obvious, flashy way, but something quiet that draws your gaze every few days, something lingering beneath your notice. It was like that with the abandoned greenhouse on Briar Lane. I passed it nearly every evening, coming home from my shift at the florist’s. It stood, dark and dilapidated, nestled behind a high iron fence nearly overwhelmed by thick ivy vines. Beyond the fencing and the tangle of weeds, the shape of the structure loomed faintly greenish beneath years of grime. Glass panes cracked like spiderwebs, their breaks catching the evening sunlight into sharp glowing edges.

I never paid it much mind, until… until the last week of May. For some reason, I'd decided, that evening, to linger longer than usual. I don’t really know why. Could have been the curiosity finally getting the better of me—maybe it was simply the tiredness setting in. Anyway, I stood by the gate and looked inside.

I hadn’t remembered seeing those flowers in there before.

Through the cracked panes, the interior was obscured by grime and the opaque bloom of years of neglect—but through gaps and fissures I could just barely make out the shapes of leaves and blossoms. Crimson flowers, utterly vibrant, seeming impossibly healthy and alive in contrast to the ruin around them. There was something peculiar about their forms, something off about their steady gentle swaying in air that couldn’t possibly move, sealed as the greenhouse was. After a few uneasy moments, I decided I'd imagined it, the glass was simply too dirty to see clearly. I told myself I'd investigate properly another day.

And I tried to forget about it. I had plenty of other worries, after all—finances, work, a strained companionship or two—but the image stuck stubbornly in my mind. Crimson petals hidden behind cracked glass. Much as I tried to distract myself, the greenhouse began to surface in my thoughts increasingly often. My commute home had begun to seem shorter, something I anticipated and dreaded in equal measure, my eyes lingering too frequently on that strange green silhouette in my mind's eye.

Then, inevitably, I went inside.

It was foolish, of course. Even while pushing open the rusted gate I felt ridiculous, as though someone might see me trespassing like a curious teenager and shout me off. But no one emerged, no voice sounded alarm, and the thick growth proved my only obstacle as I picked my path toward the greenhouse’s cracked entrance doors.

The doors were heavier than I'd thought. Chill rust ground against my palm. They protested, briefly; then slowly opened inward with an echo like old machinery unwinding somewhere beneath my feet. Warm, humid air poured from the interior like breath from a living thing.

Inside, it seemed to me far larger than appeared possible from outside. Rows upon rows of growth, creeping vine-like vegetation twisted through broken metal shelves and tangled latticework, crowding paths I was certain could not fit within the structure I had seen from the street. I pressed forward slowly, disturbed. The deeper inside I went, the higher the greenhouse’s iron rafters loomed above me, swallowed by shadows, and the darker became the glass panels overhead. No moonlight managed to penetrate the thick dirt and grime now, plunging the interior into an eerie twilight, illuminated only by the faint glow of those blood-red blossoms lining each shallow path.

Now that they surrounded me closely, there was something distinctly unsettling about the blooms. The petals quivered slowly, rhythmically, swaying as if caught gently in some faint current of air I still couldn’t feel. Upon closer inspection—though I tried vaguely to resist—each blossom seemed filled with intricate veins not unlike living flesh, faintly pulsing as though possessing separate heartbeats.

Soon I became aware that these plants moved not simply in response to some mysterious wind. They responded to me, to my movement. As I stepped forward, each flower nearest would incline its head slightly, petals spreading wider, as though turning to watch me pass. In my disturbed fascination I almost missed the other, stranger sounds rising in the spaces around me—a gentle rhythmic rustling, akin to countless whispering voices, woven together into unintelligible murmurs.

Abruptly, I realized with growing terror that I could no longer locate the door by which I'd entered. The greenhouse had somehow become labyrinthine, each pathway identical to the last. Branches hung thickly, obscuring features I'd previously been sure of, and shadows folded unrecognizably into new geometries at every turn. Panic rose, tightening around my chest. In my disorientation, I stumbled, nearly falling against one of the nearby floral growths. That was when I clearly saw it: the blossoms peeled slowly open like lips, subtly opening wide enough that in that instant I glimpsed the darkness behind them, hidden deeper down—deep enough that I was certain it descended impossibly far, a darkness very much alive, hungry, and yearning.

I ran blindly through the rows, the veil of panic growing thicker with every frantic turn until, impossibly, I spilled out into the overgrown garden outside. I collapsed to the ground, barely registering the cold biting into my scraped palms and knees, the chill of evening air battering through my gasping breath.

When finally I caught my breath and gathered my courage to turn back, the greenhouse stood closed again, still and dark—no flowers, no impossible corridors, no rustle of whispers—merely empty glass panes and wound metal framework. Quiet. Normal.

I have avoided Briar Lane since then, changing my route home to pass around several blocks farther. Sometimes, though, I still think I see that glass outline on other streets, behind other buildings, glimpsed briefly from trains or taxis. I try not to look so closely anymore.

Statement ends.

Archivist’s Notes:

Follow-up investigations at Briar Lane showed no clear evidence of unnatural phenomena, and no significant record of previous paranormal or suspicious events in that area. Bennett's descriptions certainly align with past archived statements attributed broadly to entities associated with hallucinatory spatial distortion, uncanny botany and a pervasive theme of living darkness—though I cannot yet confirm any direct connection to explicitly known variants such as "The Spiral," "The Corruption," or others in the archives. Furthermore, the greenhouse in question has reportedly been demolished several months after the statement was given, leaving few avenues of further inquiry.

Given the vivid and distinctive aspects of this account, however, I recommend additional caution in any dealings with unusual botanical specimens or unidentified abandoned structures.
