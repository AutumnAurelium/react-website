I just thought this was an interesting microcosm of my problems with GPT-4.5.

Prompt: "write me an original, interesting, and scary story in the style of an early-seasons The Magnus Archives statement"

GPT-4.5:
<blockquote>
Statement of Martin Hughes, regarding a strange and disturbing occurrence at Dunloag Lighthouse, off the coast of Scotland in July 1993. Original statement given August 12th, 1993. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, head archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

I'm not entirely sure what you hope I’ll tell you that my letters haven’t already said, though perhaps hearing it said aloud will help me put it to rest. The nightmares have persisted, and to be honest, they're the real reason I'm here at all. But I've started mid-way, haven't I? Let me start again from the beginning.

I accepted the Dunloag Lighthouse posting because it was isolated. Because the silence has always calmed my nerves, and the work was simple enough. I’d spent almost eight peaceful months there, maintaining the lamp each night, reading voraciously throughout the daylight hours, and experiencing the rare joy of my own company. Occasionally I’d meet contact on the mainland, exchange supplies and news, but it was seldom. It was peaceful there, peaceful until that night in July.

On the night of the fifth—to be exact—I noticed the fog rolling in. Thick, impenetrable, a grey shroud that swallowed the horizon. Fog's nothing unusual there, of course; visibility can shift rapidly, and I'd seen plenty of foggy nights before. But this fog was disconcerting, somehow thicker, almost gelatinous. The tendrils of vapor seemed to flow upward, coiling around the lighthouse as if measuring it, exploring it.

I tended the beacon, verifying the brightness, checking the rotation. Everything appeared functional. Then it was that I heard—or at first thought I imagined—a gentle tapping sound. It came from below, from the outside of the lighthouse wall—at sea-level, I realized with confusion. No boat could have docked there unseen in that fog, and there’s no landing to speak of on that side of the rocks.

At first, I ignored it. Wind, perhaps, waves hitting just right against the stones. But as the hours passed, the tapping continued. It wasn't rhythmic, exactly, but it was persistent, rapid little clicks like the impatient rapping of someone's fingernails upon a wooden board.

Eventually curiosity got the better of my caution. Lantern in hand, I descended the winding stair and carefully opened the lower door, stepping out into the swirling fog. The obscurity stretched only inches beyond my reach. I tried to call out—half-heartedly, I’ll admit—but my voice felt swallowed instantly by the thick white fog; it clung to my skin, oily and cold.

I edged toward the side wall where the tapping had come from, feeling along wet brick. My glove touched something soft, spongy and slick, and I recoiled. Raising the lantern, I saw dark-gray marks upon the bricks, an oily film leaving faint imprints swirling from the base up the side, disappearing higher up into the clouded darkness above. It looked almost—no, not almost—I still shudder at the thought: it looked exactly like the slime a snail leaves behind, but enormous, impossibly large.

That was when the tapping abruptly stopped. In the silence that followed, I fully grasped how utterly isolated and helpless I truly was.

I went back inside, locked the door—though what good does a lock do against fog, slime, and shadows, I don't pretend to know—and climbed immediately to the beacon room, heart hammering as I ascended. The fog had thickened impossibly now, pressing itself purposefully against the glass. With mounting dread, I saw the surface swirl and shift, and I had an insane feeling it was attempting to get inside.

Then the tapping returned, urgent this time, louder. It moved upward around the lighthouse wall, spiraling steadily closer. I stood still, unable to breathe comfortably, unable to look away. The fog settled on the windows and I glimpsed something dark forming just behind my reflection: shapes twisting and folding, rising, vaguely human-like but wrong, so wrong in movement and shape. It came closer, pressing against the glass, featureless but purposeful, hands—or something like hands—tapping insistent, gently, almost politely, determined to be let in.

I don’t know when I screamed. But suddenly my own shriek echoed against the walls, and in an instant the presence vanished, withdrawing swiftly into the fog like an animal startled by a louder predator. When morning finally dispersed the fog, there was nothing left outside to indicate what had happened, not a trace of that slippery blackness, nor any markings whatsoever on the brick or rock. I half-convinced myself I’d imagined the whole ordeal.

Except, when I left the lighthouse days later, relieved to be away, I saw a small shape half-covered by sand and seaweed on the stones on the pier. I fetched it from the rugged coastline, a shell almost as large as my palm, smooth and iridescent like mother-of-pearl. Yet twisted horribly out of shape, as though something impossibly big and distorted had forced itself free of it. A thing that should never be. A hateful little remnant of whatever visited me.

It's here, actually; I brought it. I had hoped showing it might lend me credibility, though now I realize it sounds ludicrous, even seeing it firsthand. Please, take it, I no longer wish—yes, thank you.

Since Dunloag, nightmares have overtaken my sleep. Fog encroaches everywhere now, even in the comfort of my flat, even in dreams, and in it, things soft and boneless tap endlessly against glass doors that should not exist. I never see clearly what’s there, in the dreams, only shapes writhing at the corners of my vision, soft things, whispering—pleading—to be let in. Perhaps it will fade now that I am rid of the shell, perhaps not. But know this:

Fog is no friend. And there are worse things to fear out there in that thick, pressing gloom. Things that slip from the ocean onto land—quiet, pliable, impossibly formed—and tap respectfully until someone allows them in.

Statement ends.

Archivist’s note: The shell Martin describes was catalogued and stored carefully in Artifact Storage. However, despite further attempts to contact him, Martin Hughes has thus far failed to respond. We reached out to Dunloag authorities, but no trace of the phenomena he recounted—or indeed Martin himself—has since been recovered or reported. Of course, there’s always fog at Dunloag Lighthouse.
